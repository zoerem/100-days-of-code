# 100 Days Of Code - Log

### Day 0: November 9, 2020

**Today's Progress**: Committed to starting 100 days of code. Played around with making text fade in and out but it isn't working how I want it to. 

**Thoughts:** I need to spend more time thinking about how to accomplish what I want. I should use js and not just CSS. I want the first text to exist for 10s and then fade out and I want the second text to delay for 10s and then fade in.

### Day 3: November 12, 2020

**Today's Progress**: I didn't upload anything on days 1 and 2. I started a js course and played around more.  
Today I wrote the html structure for the Jaibalito site though I need to learn how to make a contact form and then insert that. 

**Next Steps:** 
Images and CSS for the jaibalito site.
Figure out how to make a contact form. 

### Day 4: November 13, 2020

**Today's Progress**: Worked on jquery in Playing around, trying to get text to fade from one to other. Got it working then somehow made it not work. 

**Thoughts:**: So many parentheses. 

### Day 5

**Today's Progress**: Fixed some errors on my portfolio. Going to change header font.
