# 100 Days Of Code - Log

### Day 1: November 9, 2020

**Today's Progress**: Committed to starting 100 days of code. Played around with making text fade in and out but it isn't working how I want it to. 

**Thoughts:** I need to spend more time thinking about how to accomplish what I want. I should use js and not just CSS. I want the first text to exist for 10s and then fade out and I want the second text to delay for 10s and then fade in.
